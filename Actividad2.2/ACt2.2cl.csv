Welcome to my great international family in New York. Let me show you around.
I live in a 3 bedroom apartment in Astoria, Queens, with my husband Thiago, who is from Brazil and a Chinese boy Jack. I have a lot of great locations and  of course they are not in the same apartment. Most are in Astoria around us, Woodside, Jackson Heights and  MANHATTAN.  All locations are very nice, clean, well experienced hosting people from all around the world, in pretty convenient and safe  neighborhoods. You are very welcome to be part of my little, international family. 
 I am originally from Bulgaria and I speak English, Bulgarian, Russian, and a little bit of French. I am a very friendly positive person and I am also very open to foreign cultures, music, food, and customs. New York is a very unique city because people are from all around the world and contribute to the diversity of daily living.
As a professional figure skater I have participated in competitions throughout most of Europe. As a child I traveled often with my family to France, Germany, Italy, California, Tunisia and Spain. In addition, I have traveled extensively to North America, Brazil. I love to engage in sports, yoga, tennis, skating, skiing, swimming, hiking, music, dancing and I love to cook. My father and my brother in law are professional chefs. I guess I inherited the passion from them to prepare delicious foods. I would love for you to experience my cuisine.
In addition about my rooms, they all are located in a great neighborhood with restaurants, bars, international food, stores, libraries, parks, schools, shopping malls, and cinemas. Everything is nearby and convenient to public transportation which runs 24 hours a days. It is only 5-25 min to NYC. Or if you need a taxi, they are abundantly available outside the (Website hidden by Airbnb) location is located a block or a few blocks from  subway stations.

We love new things and this city is made by it. 

This is our first time here in Airbnb and we are so excited! Newbies babes here. 

We love NY, is an amazing mix of everything and we personally think that is the best part of NYC.
